PassTheWiFi makes it easy to share WiFi connection details. Instead of telling others your SSID and password, you can use PassTheWiFi to share these through NFC or QR codes.

You can use PassTheWiFi at home for guests, at the office for coworkers or at your business for customers to easily connect to your wireless network.
